******************************

Powder Keg

(2-8 Player Island Map)
Resource: Moderate (gems and gold)
Environmental Conditions: Urban
File: powdrkeg.mmx

Features: This 8-player map was created for those who enjoy the art of urban combat. Players will find vacant buildings all through out the map with a stockpile of gems in the center.

Tip: Garrison buildings quickly, use these to defend your base and advance your territory. Money will be precious, spend wisely.

Dust Bowl

(2 Player Map)
Resource: Moderate (oil derricks and gold)
Environmental Conditions: Desert
File: dustbowl.mmx

Features: Set in the small mining town of Gold Strike, players will find a moderate supply of gold ore, oil, and cows surrounding each of the starting points. Be careful, as the town's folk of Gold Strike do not take kindly to strangers.

Tip: Luckily most of the town folk are outside, so their homes are left undefended, ripe for troops to garrison. This is a fast head to head map, so think ahead!

Tower of Power

(2-4 Player Map)
Resource: Moderate (oil derricks, gems, and gold)
Environmental Conditions: Desert
File: tower.mmx

Features: This map was designed for battle. Each player will start out in one of the 4 corners of the map. Located in the center, players will find perfect space well suited for base production. The best part, the spot is located on a hill and surrounded by a moat. Your opponents will have a difficult time moving ground forces towards you if properly defended.

Tip: Move engineers quickly to the center of the map and capture the oil derricks. Once secure and defenses are constructed, move the rest of your base and begin your assault.
